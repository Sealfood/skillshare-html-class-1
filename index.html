        <h2>About Peter</h2>
        <p>Sometimes student, sometimes scientist and sometimes photographer, 
            Peter Parker is a full-time super hero better known as the web-slinging and wall-crawling Spider-Man.
            As an orphaned child, Peter was raised by his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. At a science expo, Peter was bitten by an errant radioactive spider
            which granted him an array of arachnid powers. He initially became Spider-Man to use his powers as an entertainer, growing so conceited 
            he didn't bother stopping a passerby burglar. In a twist of fate, the same burglar wound up killing Peter's Uncle Ben, 
            leading him to realize that he needed to use his powers responsibly. From then on, Spider-Man became a crime-fighting vigilante.</p>
